# Intelligent Fire Detection & Smart Warehouse Monitoring System

An AI-powered early fire detection and monitoring system that combines **CCTV-based computer vision**, **sensor fusion**, and an optional **warehouse management dashboard** to detect fire at an early stage, reduce losses, and enable faster evacuation.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional fire detection systems in warehouses rely mainly on **ceiling-mounted heat sensors**. These sensors trigger alarms only after the temperature reaches a high threshold.  
By the time this happens:
- Fire has already spread
- Large quantities of goods are damaged
- Evacuation becomes unsafe
- Economic losses increase significantly

This delay makes existing systems **reactive rather than preventive**.

---

## Proposed Solution

We developed an **Intelligent Fire Detection and Monitoring System** that uses a **fusion of CCTV cameras and environmental sensors** to detect fire **before heat accumulates at the ceiling level**.

### Key Idea
> Fire is visible before it becomes hot enough to trigger traditional sensors.

---

## How It Works

1. **CCTV cameras** continuously monitor warehouse zones  
2. **Machine Learning models** analyze live video feeds to detect fire or smoke  
3. Once detected, the system **triggers an early warning immediately** (no waiting)  
4. **Sensors** analyze temperature and gas trends to validate and escalate the response  
5. **Alerts, alarms, and evacuation warnings** are initiated  
6. A **web dashboard** displays live status, alerts, and logs  
7. *(Optional)* A **fire robot** can assist in evacuation and fire containment
